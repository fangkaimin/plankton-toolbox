# Plankton Toolbox #

The Plankton Toolbox is a free tool for aquatic scientists, and others, working with environmental monitoring related to phyto- and zooplankton.

## Features ##

  * Counting module for use by the microscope
  * Imports phyto- or zooplankton data in .txt and .xlsx files in different formats (configurable)
  * Work with data on abundance, biovolume and carbon content
  * Data screening - quality control of data (in early development)
  * Aggregate data, e.g. from species level to class level
  * Plotting tools
  * Statistics (in early development)
  * Export data in .txt or .xlsx for further analysis or plotting

## Preloaded data ##

To run the Plankton Toolbox there should be a folder named toolbox_data in the 
same folder as the executable file. It contains species lists, parsers (used for dataset imports)
and code-lists for screening. These files can be modified by the user and new files can be added 
if the default set of files can't be used. Internal files for the counting module are also 
stored here.
